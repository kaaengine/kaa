    :synopsis: Your objects on the scene


:class:`Node` reference
-----------------------

Nodes are the core concept of the kaa engine. They're "objects" which you can add to the Scene. Each Node has its
spatial properties such as position, rotation or scale. A Node may also have a sprite (graphics loaded from a file),
:ref:`which can be animated <Transitions.NodeSpriteTransition>`. Nodes have other properties such as z_index, shape,
color, origin etc. All those properties are described in the documentation below.

A Node can have child Nodes, which you can add with the :meth:`Node.add_child`
method, thus creating a tree-like structure of nodes on the scene. As the parent node gets transformed (changes its position,
rotation or scale) all its children nodes will transform accordingly.

Each :class:`engine.Scene` instance has a root node - this is the first node on the Scene to which you can start adding
your own Nodes.

A node without a sprite image (or without a shape and color properties set explicitly) will be just a logical entity
on the scene, in other words: you won't see it. Such logical Nodes are often very useful, for example, as a containers
for grouping other nodes.

Although the bare :class:`Node` will do its job well and allow you to create simple games, the Kaa engine comes with
a collection of other specialized Nodes (they all inherit from the :class:`Node` class):

* :class:`physics.SpaceNode` - a container node to simulate the physical environment.
* :class:`physics.BodyNode` - a physical node which can have hitbox nodes. Can interact with other BodyNodes. Must be a direct child of SpaceNode. Can have zero or more Hitbox Nodes.
* :class:`physics.HitboxNode` - defines an area that can collide with other hitboxes, and allows wiring up your own collision handler function. Hitbox Node must be a child node of a BodyNode.
* :class:`fonts.TextNode` - a node used to render text on the screen.

For your game's actual objects such as Player, Enemy, Bullet, etc. we recommend writing classes that inherit from
the Node class (or BodyNode if you want the object to utilize :doc:`kaaengine's physics features </reference/physics>`).

.. class:: Node(position=Vector(0,0), rotation=0, scale=Vector(1, 1), z_index=None, color=Color(0,0,0,0), sprite=None, shape=None, origin_alignment=Alignment.center, lifetime=None, transition=None, visible=True, views=None)

    A basic example how to create a new Node (with a sprite) and add it to the Scene:

    .. code-block:: python

        from kaa.nodes import Node
        from kaa.sprites import Sprite
        from kaa.geometry import Vector
        import os

        # inside a Scene's __init__ :
        my_sprite = Sprite(os.path.join('assets', 'gfx', 'arrow.png')  # create a sprite from image file
        self.node = Node(position=Vector(100, 100), sprite=my_sprite))  # create a Node at (100, 100) with the sprite
        self.root.add_child(self.node)  # until you add the Node to the Scene it won't not show up on the screen!

Instance Properties:

.. _Node.children:
.. attribute:: Node.children

    Returns a list of child nodes of this Node.

.. _Node.scene:
.. attribute:: Node.scene

    Returns a :class:`Scene` instance to which this Node belongs. Will be None if the node has not been added to any
    Scene yet. Use :meth:`Node.add_child` method to add nodes. Each Scene has a root node to which you can add nodes.

.. _Node.position:
.. attribute:: Node.position

    Gets or sets node position, as a :class:`geometry.Vector`.

    **IMPORTANT:** Node position is always get or set relative to its parent node. To get the absolute position,
    use the :ref:`absolute_position<Node.absolute_position>` property.

    If the Node is few levels deep in the nodes hierarchy and you want to know the position
    of the node in relation to one of its ancestors, use :meth:`get_relative_position()` method.

    .. code-block:: python

        from kaa.nodes import Node
        from kaa.geometry import Vector

        # inside a Scene's __init__ :
        self.node1 = Node(position = Vector(100, 100))
        self.root.add_child(self.node1)  # adding to scene's root node, so node1 absolute position is (100, 100)
        # create a child node
        self.node2 = Node(position = Vector(-20, 30))
        self.node1.add_child(self.node2)
        print(self.node2.position) # prints out V[-20, 30]
        print(self.node2.absolute_position) # prints out V[80, 130]


    Also see: :ref:`Node origin points <Node.origin_alignment>`.

.. _Node.absolute_position:
.. attribute:: Node.absolute_position

    Read only. Gets an absolute position of the node, i.e. the position on the scene. Returns :class:`geometry.Vector`.

    Check out the example in the :ref:`position <Node.position>` property section.

.. _Node.parent:
.. attribute:: Node.parent

    Retruns this node's parent :class:`Node`, or None in case of the root node.

.. _Node.z_index:
.. attribute:: Node.z_index

    Gets or sets node z_index (integer). Nodes with higher z_index will overlap those with lower z_index when drawn
    on the screen. Default z_index is None meaning the node will inherit z_index value from its parent. Scene's
    root node (:attr:`engine.Scene.root`) has z_index = 0.

    .. note::

        If parent and child nodes have the same z_index, then the child node will be rendered on top of the parent.

.. _Node.rotation:
.. attribute:: Node.rotation

    Gets or sets node rotation, in radians. There is no capping value, meaning you can set it to values greater
    than :code:`math.pi*2` or lower than :code:`-math.pi*2`.

    **IMPORTANT:** Node rotation is always get or set relative to its parent node. To get the absolute rotation,
    use the :ref:`absolute_rotation <Node.absolute_rotation>` property.

    Changing node rotation will make the node rotate around its origin point. Read more about
    :ref:`Node origin points <Node.origin_alignment>`.

    .. code-block:: python

        import math
        from kaa.nodes import Node
        from kaa.geometry import Vector

        # inside a Scene's __init__ :
        # add node 1
        self.node1 = Node(position = Vector(100, 100), rotation=math.pi / 4)
        self.root.add_child(self.node1)
        # add node 2 as child of node 1
        self.node2 = Node(position = Vector(10, 10), rotation=math.pi / 4)
        self.node1.add_child(self.node2)

        print(self.node1.rotation) # 0.7853981633974483 (math.pi / 4)
        print(self.node2.rotation) # 0.7853981633974483 (math.pi / 4)
        print(self.node2.absolute_rotation) # 1.5707963705062866 (math.pi / 2)


.. _Node.absolute_rotation:
.. attribute:: Node.absolute_rotation

    Read only. Returns an absolute rotation of the node, in radians. Check out the example in
    the :ref:`rotation <Node.rotation>` property section.

.. _Node.rotation_degrees:
.. attribute:: Node.rotation_degrees

    Same as :ref:`rotation <Node.rotation>` property, but uses degrees (as float). There is no capping value,
    meaning you can set it to values greater than 360 degrees or smaller than -360 degrees.

    Changing node rotation will make the node rotate around its origin point. Read more about
    :ref:`Node origin points <Node.origin_alignment>`.

    See also: :ref:`absolute_rotation_degrees <Node.absolute_rotation_degrees>`.

.. _Node.absolute_rotation_degrees:
.. attribute:: Node.absolute_rotation_degrees

    Read only. Same as :ref:`absolute_rotation <Node.absolute_rotation>` but returns degrees.

.. _Node.scale:
.. attribute:: Node.scale

    Gets or sets the node scale, as :class:`geometry.Vector`.

    **IMPORTANT:** Node scale is always get or set relative to its parent node. To get the absolute scale,
    use the :ref:`absolute_scale <Node.absolute_scale>` property.

    The x value of the vector represents scaling in the X axis, while y value is for scaling in the Y axis.
    Negative values of x or y are possible - it will make the node to be rendered as a mirror reflection in
    X and/or Y axis respectively.

    .. code-block:: python

        import math
        from kaa.nodes import Node
        from kaa.geometry import Vector

        # inside a Scene's __init__ :
        self.node1 = Node(position = Vector(100, 100))
        self.root.add_child(self.node1)
        self.node1.scale = Vector(2, 0.5)  # stretch the node by a factor of 2 in the X axis and shrink it by a factor of 0.5 in the Y axis

        # add a child node
        self.node2 = Node(position=Vector(-5, -15), scale=Vector(4, 0.5))
        self.node1.add_child(self.node2)

        print(self.node1.scale)  # V[2.0, 0.5]
        print(self.node2.scale)  # V[4.0, 0.5]
        print(self.node2.absolute_scale)  # V[8.0, 0.25]


.. _Node.absolute_scale:
.. attribute:: Node.absolute_scale

    Read only. Returns an absolute scale, as :class:`geometry.Vector`. Check out the example in the
    :ref:`scale <Node.scale>` property section.

.. _Node.visible:
.. attribute:: Node.visible

    Gets or sets the visibility of the node (shows or hides it), using bool.

    Makes most sense for nodes which are rendered on the screen such as nodes having sprites, or text nodes.

    Note that this has only a visual effect, so for example setting :code:`visible` to :code:`False` on a
    :class:`physics.HitboxNode` will not make the hitbox inactive - it will still detect collisions normally.

    Setting visible to :code:`False` will hide all of its child nodes (recursively) as well.

.. _Node.sprite:
.. attribute:: Node.sprite

    Gets or sets a :class:`sprites.Sprite` for the node.

    A sprite is an immutable object that wraps a graphical image.

    Assigning a Sprite to a Node will make the sprite be displayed at node's position, with node's rotation and scale.

    Creating a frame by frame animation is a two step process:

    First you'll need to have a list of frames, each frame being an individual :class:`sprites.Sprite` instance. You can load
    each frame from a separate file or, if you have a spritesheet (a single graphical file which includes all frames) use
    the utility function :meth:`sprites.split_spritesheet()` to cut the sprites out of the file.

    Second, you'll need to create a :class:`transitions.NodeSpriteTransition` transition using the list of sprites,
    which also allows you to specify the animation duration, looping etc. and
    :ref:`assign that transition to the node <Node.transition>`

    .. note::

        Transitions are a more general mechanism than just sprite animations. :doc:`Read more about transitions here. </reference/transitions>`.

    Since sprite is a dimensional object (has its width and height) and node position is just a 2D (x, y) coords,
    it is important to understand the concept of node's origin point. Read more
    about :ref:`Node origin points <Node.origin_alignment>`.

    Example 1 - a node with a static sprite.

    .. code-block:: python

        from kaa.nodes import Node
        from kaa.sprites import Sprite
        from kaa.geometry import Vector, Alignment
        import os

        # inside a Scene's __init__ :
        my_sprite = Sprite(os.path.join('assets', 'gfx', 'arrow.png')  # create a sprite from image file
        self.node = Node(position=Vector(100, 100), sprite=my_sprite))  # create a Node at (100, 100) with the sprite
        self.node.origin_alignment = Alignment.center # this makes the (100, 100) position be at the center of the sprite
        self.root.add_child(self.node)  # until you add the Node to the Scene it won't show up on the screen!

    Example 2 - a node with frame by frame animation running in an infinite loop:

    .. code-block:: python

        from kaa.nodes import Node
        from kaa.sprites import Sprite
        from kaa.geometry import Vector
        from kaa.transitions import NodeSpriteTransition

        # inside a Scene's __init__:
        spritesheet = Sprite(os.path.join('assets', 'gfx', 'spritesheet.png')  # a 1000x1000 spritesheet with hundred 100x100 frames
        frames = split_spritesheet(spritesheet, Vector(100,100)) # cut the spritesheet into 100 individual <Sprite> instances
        animation = NodeSpriteTransition(frames, duration=2., loops=0, back_and_forth=False) # With 100 frames a duration of 2 secs means 20 miliseconds per frame.
        self.node = Node(position=Vector(100, 100), transition=animation)  # the transition will take care of setting the appropriate <Sprite> over time, thus creating an animation effect.
        self.root.add_child(self.node)  # until you add the Node to the Scene it won't show up on the screen!

    To stop playing an animation simply set the node's transition to :code:`None`

.. _Node.color:
.. attribute:: Node.color

    Gets or sets the color of the shape of the node, using :class:`colors.Color`.

    In practice, if a node has a sprite that means that a sprite will be tinted in that color.

    If a node does not have a sprite it still can have a shape (see the :ref:`shape <Node.shape>` property).
    In that case setting a color will make the shape be rendered in that color.

    For text nodes (:class:`fonts.TextNode`) it gets or sets the color of the text.

    It is often useful to set a color for hitbox nodes (:class:`physics.HitboxNode`) to see where the hitboxes are in
    relation to the node's sprite. Just remember to set a high enough z_index on the hitbox node.

    The default color of a Node is a "transparent" color (r=0, g=0, b=0, a=0).

.. _Node.shape:
.. attribute:: Node.shape

    Gets or sets a shape of a Node. A shape can be one of the following types:

    * :code:`None` - this is the default value (no shape)
    * :class:`geometry.Circle` - the shape has a form of a circle
    * :class:`geometry.Polygon` - the shape has a form of a polygon.

    The most common scenario for setting a shape manually is for the hitbox nodes (:class:`physics.HitboxNode`). It
    defines an area that will generate collisions. More information is available in the
    :doc:`physics module documentation </reference/physics>`).

    If you set a Sprite for a Node, its shape will be automatically set to a rectangular polygon corresponding with the
    size of the sprite.

    Overriding sprite node's shape is usually not necessary, but you can always do that. For example, you can set
    a 100x200 px sprite for a node and then set a custom shape e.g. a non-rectangular polygon or a circle.
    The drawn image will be fit inside the defined shape.

.. _Node.origin_alignment:
.. attribute:: Node.origin_alignment

    Gets or sets origin alignment of a node, as :class:`geometry.Alignment`.

    It's best to show what origin point is on an example. Assume you have a Node with a 100x50 px :ref:`sprite <Node.sprite>`.
    You tell the engine to draw the node at some specific position e.g. :code:`position=Vector(300, 200)`.
    But what does this actually mean? Which pixel of the 100x50 image will really be drawn at (300, 200)?
    The top-left pixel? Or the central pixel? Or maybe some other pixel?

    By default it's the central pixel and that reference point is called the 'origin'. By setting the
    origin_alignment you can change the position of the point to one of the 9 default positions: from top left,
    through center to the bottom right.

    Setting the origin alignment is especially useful when working with text nodes (:class:`fonts.TextNode`) as it
    allows you to align text to the left or right.

    If you need a custom origin point position, not just one of the 9 default values, you can always wrap a node
    with a parent node. Remember that node positions are always set in relation to their parents, so by creating a
    parent-child node relations and setting origin_alignment appropriately, you can lay out the nodes on the scene
    any way you want.

.. _Node.lifetime:
.. attribute:: Node.lifetime

    Gets or sets a lifetime of the node, in seconds.

    By default nodes live forever. After you add them to the scene with :meth:`Node.add_child` method they will stay
    there until you delete them by calling :meth:`Node.delete`.

    Setting the lifetime of a node will remove the node automatically from the scene after given number of
    seconds. It's important to note that the timer starts ticking after you add the node to the scene, not
    when you instantiate the node.

.. _Node.transition:
.. attribute:: Node.transition

    Gets or sets a default transition object.

    Transitions are "recipes" how the node's properties (such as position, rotation, scale, color, sprite, etc.) should
    evolve over time. Transitions system is a very powerful feature,
    :doc:`refer to transitions documentation for details </reference/transitions>`.

.. _Node.transitions_manager:
.. attribute:: Node.transitions_manager

    Read only. Returns a :class:`transitions.NodeTransitionsManager` object which allows you to manage multiple
    transitions on a Node.

    Transitions are "recipes" how the node's properties (such as position, rotation, scale, color, sprite, etc.) should
    evolve over time. Transitions system is a very powerful feature,
    :doc:`refer to transitions documentation for details </reference/transitions>`.


.. _Node.absolute_transformation:
.. attribute:: Node.absolute_transformation

    Gets the absolute transformation of the Node, in form of a :class:`geometry.Transformation` instance.


.. _Node.transformation:
.. attribute:: Node.transformation

    Gets or sets the transformation of the Node, in form of a :class:`geometry.Transformation` instance.
    Applying a transformation to the node is an equivalent of changing its :ref:`position <Node.position>`
    (translate Transformation), :ref:`rotation <Node.rotation>` (rotating Transformation) or
    :ref:`scale <Node.scale>` (scaling Transtofmation). Refer to :class:`geometry.Transformation` for more
    details on how to work with transformation objects.

.. _Node.views:
.. attribute:: Node.views

    Gets or sets indexes of views (as a set object) in which this node shall be rendered. Each scene can have a maximum
    of 32 views (indexed -16 to 15). Default value is None meaning the node will inherit the view from its parent. Note that the
    :ref:`root node of the scene <Scene.root>` has a view set to {0} (a set with just one element: zero) by default, so all
    nodes added to root (and their children) will have a views value set to {0}. Read more about views in :class:`engine.View` reference.

    .. code-block:: python

        self.root.add_child(Node(position=Vector(32,45), sprite=some_sprite))  # will be rendered in the default view
        self.root.add_child(Node(position=Vector(-432,-445), sprite=some_sprite, views={0, 1, 15}))  # will be rendered in views 0, 1 and 15


    .. code-block:: python

        node = Node(views={13})  # node will be rendered in view 13
        child = Node()
        node.add_child(child)  # the child will also be rendered in view 13

.. _Node.indexable:
.. attribute:: Node.indexable

    Gets or sets whether the node is indexable (as :code:`bool`). Default is :code:`True`. If set to `True`, this Node
    will be queryable by the :class:`engine.SpatialIndexManager`.

    Setting this value to False yields a slight performance boost.

.. _Node.bounding_box:
.. attribute:: Node.bounding_box

    Returns node's bounding box as :class:`geometry.BoundingBox`. Bounding box is X/Y axis - aligned rectangle that
    contains :ref:`Node's shape <Node.shape>`.

Instance Methods:

.. method:: Node.add_child(child_node)

    Adds a child node to the current node. The child_node must be a :class:`Node` type or subtype.

    Each Scene always has a :ref:`root node <Scene.root>`, which allows to add your first nodes.

    When a parent node gets transformed (repositioned, scaled, rotated), all its child nodes are transformed
    accordingly.

    You can build the node tree freely, with some exceptions:

    * :class:`physics.BodyNode` must be a direct child of a :class:`physics.SpaceNode`
    * :class:`physics.HitboxNode` must be a direct child of a :class:`physics.BodyNode`

.. method:: Node.delete()

    Deletes a node from the scene. All child nodes get deleted automatically as well.

    **Important:** The node gets deleted immediately so you should not read any of the deleted node's properties
    afterwards. It may result in segmentation fault error and the whole process crashing down.

    See also: :ref:`Node lifetime <Node.lifetime>`

.. method:: Node.get_relative_position(ancestor)

    Returns node's position (:class:`geometry.Vector`) relative to given ancestor.

    The :code:`ancestor` parameter must be a :class:`Node` and it must be an ancestor of a node on which the method
    is called.

.. method:: Node.get_relative_transformation(ancestor)

    Returns node's transformation (:class:`geomtry.Transformation`) relative to given ancestor.

    The :code:`ancestor` parameter must be a :class:`Node` and it must be an ancestor of a node on which the method
    is called.

.. method:: Node.on_detach()

    You don't call this method directly. Instead you can implement it on a class that inherits from Node. The method
    gets called when the node is removed from the scene (by calling delete(), its lifetime expiring, scene being
    destroyed, and so on...).

    Once the node gets removed, accessing its properties results in an error, so :code:`on_detach()` offers an
    opportunity to execute some cleanup code.

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyBulletNode(Node):

            def on_detach(self):
                # remove the node from our own custom collection
                self.scene.my_bullets_manager.remove_bullet(self)


.. method:: Node.on_attach()

    You don't call this method directly. Instead you can implement it on a class that inherits from Node. The method
    gets called when the node is added to the scene.

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyBulletNode(Node):

            def on_attach(self):
                # add the node to our own custom collection
                self.scene.my_bullets_manager.add_bullet(self)


.. method:: Node.__bool__(self)

    Allows to inspect the node to verify if it's in a valid state.

    .. code-block:: python

        # ... inside a scene ....
        node = Node()
        self.root.add_child(node)
        assert node
        node.delete()
        assert not node
