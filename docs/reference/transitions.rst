    :synopsis: A quick and easy way to automate transforming your nodes

When writing a game you'll often want to apply a set of known transformations to a :class:`nodes.Node`. For example, you want your
Node to move 100 pixels to the right, then wait 3 seconds and return 100 pixels to the left. Or you'll want the node
to pulsate (smoothly change its scale between some min and max values), or rotate back and forth. YOu may want to have
any combination of those effects applied (either one after another or parallel). Thereâ€™s an unlimited number of such
visual transformations and their combinations, that you may want to have in your game.

You can of course implement all this, by having a set of boolean flags, time trackers, etc. and use all those helper
variables to manually change the desired properties of your nodes from within the update() method. But there is an
easier way: the mechanism is called Transitions. A single Transition object is a recipe of how a given property
of a Node (position, scale, rotation, color, sprite, etc.) should change over time. Transition can be played once,
given number of times or in a loop. You can also chains transitions to run one after another or in parallel.

Transitions are the primary way of creating animations. Since animation is nothing else than just
changing Node's sprite over time, the transition mechanism comes useful for that purpose.


Common transition parameters
----------------------------

**Note**: All transitions are immutable.

To create a Transition you'll typically need to pass the following parameters:

* :code:`advance_value` - advance value for given transition type (e.g. target position for :class:`NodePositionTransition`).
* :code:`duration` - transition duration time, in seconds
* :code:`advance_method` - an enum value of :class:`AttributeTransitionMethod` type which determines how the :code:`advance_value` will be applied to modify the appropriate node property.
    * :code:`AttributeTransitionMethod.set` - node's property will be changed towards the advance_value over time
    * :code:`AttributeTransitionMethod.add` - node's property will be changed towards the current value + advance_value over time
    * :code:`AttributeTransitionMethod.multiply` - node's property will be changed towards the current value * advance_value over time
* :code:`loops` - Optional. How many times the transition should "play". Set to 0 to play infinite number of times. Default is 1.
* :code:`back_and_forth` - Optional. If set to :code:`True`, the transition will be played back and forth (that counts as one "loop"). Default is False.
* :code:`easing` - Optional. An enum value of :class:`easings.Easing` - specifies the rate of change of a value over time. Default is Easing.none which really means a linear easing.

.. note::

    The :code:`duration` parameter always refers to one loop, one direction. So for example, transition
    with the following set of parameters: :code:`duration=1., loops=3, back_and_forth=True` will take 6 seconds.
    1 second played back and forth is 2 seconds, and it will be played 3 times, hence a total time
    of 6 seconds.

.. note::

    If :code:`back_and_forth` is set to :code:`True`, the transition will play back and forth which counts as one loop.

All transitions use linear easing. More built-in easing types are to be added soon.

:class:`NodePositionTransition` reference
-----------------------------------------

.. class:: NodePositionTransition(advance_value, duration, advance_method=AttributeTransitionMethod.set, loops=1, back_and_forth=False, easing=Easing.none)

    Use this transition to change Node's position gradually over time, towards given advance_value or by given advance_value.

    The :code:`advance_value` param must be a :class:`geometry.Vector` and is the target position value (or position change value)

    Refer to the `Common transition parameters`_ and `Examples`_ sections for information on other parameters used by the transition.


:class:`NodeRotationTransition` reference
-----------------------------------------


.. class:: NodeRotationTransition(advance_value, duration, advance_method=AttributeTransitionMethod.set, loops=1, back_and_forth=False, easing=Easing.none)

    Use this transition to change Node's rotation gradually over time, towards given advance_value or by given advance_value.

    The :code:`advance_value` param must be a float and is the target rotation value (or rotation change value), *in radians*.

    Refer to the `Common transition parameters`_ and `Examples`_ sections for information on other parameters used by the transition.


:class:`NodeScaleTransition` reference
--------------------------------------

.. class:: NodeScaleTransition(value, duration, advance_method=AttributeTransitionMethod.set, loops=1, back_and_forth=False, easing=Easing.none)

    Use this transition to change Node's scale gradually over time, towards given advance_value or by given advance_value.

    The :code:`advance_value` param must be a :class:`geometry.Vector` and is the target scale value (or scale change value) for X and Y axis respectively.

    Refer to the `Common transition parameters`_ and `Examples`_ sections for information on other parameters used by the transition.


:class:`NodeColorTransition` reference
--------------------------------------


.. class:: NodeColorTransition(value, duration, advance_method=AttributeTransitionMethod.set, loops=1, back_and_forth=False, easing=Easing.none)

    Use this transition to change Node's scale gradually over time, towards given advance_value or by given advance_value.

    The :code:`advance_value` param must be a :class:`colors.Color` and is the target color value (or color change value).

    Note that each component of the color (R, G, B, and A) is trimmed to a 0-1 range, so when using
    :code:`advance_method=AttributeTransitionMethod.set` or :code:`advance_method=AttributeTransitionMethod.multiply`
    which would result in R G B or A going above 1 or below 0 - the value will be capped at 1 and 0 respectively.

    Refer to the `Common transition parameters`_ and `Examples`_ sections for information on other parameters used by the transition.


:class:`BodyNodeVelocityTransition` reference
---------------------------------------------

.. class:: BodyNodeVelocityTransition(value, duration, advance_method=AttributeTransitionMethod.set, loops=1, back_and_forth=False, easing=Easing.none)

    The :code:`advance_value` param must be a :class:`geometry.Vector` and is the target velocity value (or velocity change value).

    Refer to the `Common transition parameters`_ and `Examples`_ sections for information on other parameters used by the transition.


:class:`BodyNodeAngularVelocityTransition` reference

    Use this transition to change BodyNode's angular velocity gradually over time, towards given advance_value or by
    given advance_value.

    The :code:`advance_value` param must be a number and is the target angular velocity value (or angular velocity
    change value), *in radians*

    Refer to the `Common transition parameters`_ and `Examples`_ sections for information on other parameters used
    by the transition.

.. _Transitions.NodeSpriteTransition:

:class:`NodeSpriteTransition` reference
---------------------------------------

.. class:: NodeSpriteTransition(sprites, duration, loops=1, back_and_forth=False, easing=Easing.none)

    Use this transition to create animations. The transition will change Node's sprite over time specified by
    the :code:`duration` parameter, iterating through sprites list specified by the :code:`sprites` parameter.

    The :code:`sprites` must be an iterable holding :class:`sprites.Sprite` instances. To cut a spritesheet file into
    individual sprites (individual frames) use the utility function :meth:`sprites.split_spritesheet()`

    The :code:`loops` and :code:`back_and_forth` parameters work normally - refer to the `Common transition parameters`_
    section for more information on those parameters.

:class:`NodeZIndexSteppingTransition reference`
-----------------------------------------------

.. class:: NodeZIndexSteppingTransition(z_index_list, duration, loops=1, back_and_forth=False, easing=Easing.none)

    Allows to change z_index of a node over time.

    The :code:`z_index_list` must be an iterable with z_index values.


:class:`NodeTransitionsSequence` reference
------------------------------------------

.. class:: NodeTransitionSequence(transitions, loops=1, back_and_forth=False)

    A wrapping container used to chain transitions into a sequence. The sequence will run one transition at a time,
    next one being executed when the previous one finishes.

    The :code:`transitions` parameter is an iterable of transitions.

    The iterable can include a list of 'atomic' transitions such as :class:`NodePositionTransition`,
    :class:`NodeScaleTransition`,  :class:`NodeColorTransition` etc. as well as other
    :class:`NodeTransitionSequence`, or :class:`NodeTransitionsParallel` thus building
    a more complex structure.

    The loops and back_and_forth parameters work normally, but are applied to the whole sequence.

    See the `Examples`_ sections for a sample code using NodeTransitionSequence.


:class:`NodeTransitionsParallel` reference
------------------------------------------

.. class:: NodeTransitionsParallel(transitions, loops=1, back_and_forth=False)

    A wrapping container used to make transitions run in parallel.

    The :code:`transitions` parameter is an iterable of transitions which will be executed simultaneously.

    The iterable can include a list of 'atomic' transitions such as :class:`NodePositionTransition`,
    :class:`NodeScaleTransition`,  :class:`NodeColorTransition` etc. as well as other
    :class:`NodeTransitionSequence`, or :class:`NodeTransitionsParallel` thus building
    a more complex structure.

    You may have two contradictory transitions running in parallel, for example two :class:`NodePositionTransition`
    trying to change node position in opposite directions. Contrary to intuition, they wonâ€™t cancel out (regardless
    of advance_method being :code:`add` or :code:`set`). If there are two or more transitions of the same type running in paralel,
    then the one which is later in the list will be used and all the preceding ones will be ignored.

    Since transitions runing in parallel may have different durations, the :code:`loops` parameter is using the
    following logic: The longest duration is considered the "base" duration. Transitions whose duration is shorter than
    the base duration will wait (doing nothing) when they complete, until the one with the "base" duration ends.
    When the "base" transition ends, the new loop begins and all transitions start running in parallel again.

    The :code:`back_and_forth=True` is using the same logic: the engine will wait for the longest transition to end
    before playing all parallel transitions backwards.

    See the `Examples`_ sections for a sample code using NodeTransitionsParallel.

    Like all other transitions, NodeTransitionsParallel is immutable. That causes problems when you want transitions
    to be managed independently. Consider a situation where you want to have a Node with sprite animation
    (NodeSpriteTransition) and some other transition (e.g. NodePositionTransition), both running simuntaneously. Suppose
    you do that by wrapping the two transitions in :class:`NodeTransitionsParallel`. Now, if you want to change just
    the sprite animation transition **without changing the state of the position transition** (a perfectly valid case
    in many 2D games), you won't be able to do that because NodeTransitionsParallel is immutable!

    To solve that problem, you should use :code:`NodeTransitionsManager` - it allows running and managing multiple
    simultaneous transitions on a Node truly independently from each other.


:class:`NodeTransitionDelay` reference
--------------------------------------

.. class:: NodeTransitionDelay(duration)

    Use this transition to create a delay between transitions in a sequence.

    The :code:`duration` parameter is a number of seconds.

    See the `Examples`_ sections for more information.


:class:`NodeTransitionCallback` reference
-----------------------------------------

.. class:: NodeTransitionCallback(callback_func)

    Use this transition to get your own function called at a specific moment in a transitions sequence. A typical use
    case is to find out that a transition has ended.

    The :code:`callback_func` must be a callable.

    See the `Examples`_ sections for a sample code using NodeTransitionCallback


:class:`NodeCustomTransition` reference
---------------------------------------

.. class:: NodeCustomTransition(prepare_func, evaluate_func, duration, loops=1, back_and_forth=False, easing=Easing.none)

    Use this class to write your own transition.

    :code:`prepare_func` must be a callable. It will be called once, before the transition is played. It receives one
    parameter - a node. It can return any value, which will later be used as input to :code:`evaluate_func`

    :code:`evaluate_func` must be a callable. It will be called on each frame and it's the place where you should
    implement the transition logic. It will receive three parameters: :code:`state`, :code:`node` and :code:`t`.
    The :code:`state` is a value you have returned in the :code:`prepare_func` callable. The :code:`node` is a
    node which is transitioning. The :code:`t` parameter is a value between 0 and 1 which indicates
    transition time duration progress.

    The :code:`loops` and :code:`back_and_forth` paramters behave normally - see the `Common transition parameters`_
    section.

    .. code-block:: python

        custom_transition = NodeCustomTransition(
                lambda node: {'positions': [
                    Vector(random.uniform(-100, 100), random.uniform(-100, 100))
                    for _ in range(10)
                ]},
                lambda state, node, t: setattr(
                    node, 'position',
                    state['positions'][min(int(t * 10), 9)],
                ),
                10.,
                loops=5,
            )


:class:`NodeTransitionsManager` reference
-----------------------------------------

.. class:: NodeTransitionsManager

    Node Transitions Manager is accessed by the transitions_manager property on a :class:`nodes.Node`. It allows to
    run multiple transitions on a node at the same time. Unlike :class:`NodeTransitionsParallel`, which also runs multiple
    transitions simultaneously, the transitions managed by the NodeTransitionsManager are truly isolated. It
    means you can manage them (stop or replace them) **individually** not affecting other running transitions. This is
    not possible with transitions inside :class:`NodeTransitionsParallel`, because the wrapper is immutable.

    The manager offers a simple dictionary-like interface with two methods: :meth:`get()` and :meth:`set()` to access and set
    transitions by a string key.

    Note that the transition manager is used when you set transition on a Node via the
    :ref:`transition property <Node.transition>`. That transition can be accessed via :code:`get('__default__')`

    Similarly to :class:`NodeTransitionsParallel` when you set two contradictory transitions of the same type to run on
    the manager (for example position transitions that pull the node in two opposite direction) - they will not cancel
    out. One of them will 'dominate'. It is undetermined which one will dominate therefore it's recommended not to
    compose transitions that way (why would you want to do it anyway?).

.. method:: NodeTransitionsManager.get(transition_name)

    Gets a transition by name (a string).

    :code:`Node.transitions_manager.get('__default__')` is an equivalent of :ref:`Node.transition <Node.transition>` getter.

.. method:: NodeTransitionsManager.set(transition_name, transition)

    Sets a transition with a specific name (a string). The :code:`transition` object can be any transition, either
    'atomic' or a serial / parallel combo.

    :code:`Node.transitions_manager.set('__default__', transition)` is an equivalent of :ref:`Node.transition <Node.transition>` setter.

    .. code-block:: python

        node = Node(position=Vector(15, 60))
        node.transitions_manager.set('my_transition', NodePositionTransition(Vector(100,100), duration=0.300, loops=0))
        node.transitions_manager.set('other_transition', NodeRotationTransition(math.pi/2))
        node.transitions_manager.set('can_use_sequence_coz_why_not',  NodeTransitionsSequence([
            NodeScaleTransition(Vector(2, 2), 1.),
            NodeTransitionDelay(2.),
            NodeColorTransition(Color(0.5, 1, 0, 1), 3.)],
            loops=2, back_and_forth=True))


:class:`AttributeTransitionMethod` reference
--------------------------------------------

.. class:: AttributeTransitionMethod

Enum type used to identify value advance method when using transitions

Available values are:

* :code:`AttributeTransitionMethod.set`
* :code:`AttributeTransitionMethod.add`
* :code:`AttributeTransitionMethod.multiply`
